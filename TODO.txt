# @TODO

## Review direct variable property access
- review ->value{$index} in ForTag
- review ->(step|total|first|last|do_else|key|show|iteration|index)
- review ->tpl_vars, ->config_vars, ->value

- Re-introduce merge_compiled_includes and the {include inline} attribute?

## Beatify output
- strip <?php and ?> tags from generated output

## Review public static vars
- such as _CHARSET and _IS_WINDOWS

## Build
- add compiled lexers and parsers to Release assets automatically

## Benchmark
- benchmark to see that performance hasn't degraded

## Block / inheritance
- Consider phasing out $smarty.block.child as this reverses the inheritance hierarchy and might cause infinite loops
  when combined with $smarty.block.parent


## Plugin system
- fix template security checks in one place in compiler


## Documentation
- beautify and review docs, possibly using [
Material for MkDocs ](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/)

## Resources
- Fix circular deps between resources and sources
```
	$smarty = $this->_getSmartyObj();
		[$name, $type] = \Smarty\Resource\BasePlugin::parseResourceName($config_file, $smarty->default_config_type);
		$source = new Config($smarty, $config_file, $type, $name);

		$source->handler->getContent($source);
```

## Unrelated / other
- review (and avoid) use of 'clone' keyword
- compiler->has_code seems silly. Why not have proper return values?
- what is 'user literal support', why are unit tests skipped?
