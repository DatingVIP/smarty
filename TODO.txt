## Data, TemplateBase, Smarty, Template, Debug, DataObject mess:
- [ ] review usages of ->_getSmartyObj and ->smarty: maybe change this so we can hide more
- [ ] ->_objType and ->objMap
- [ ] refactor _isTplObj, _isDataObj
- [ ] look for and remove @method  and @property phpdoc tags

- [ ] remove `require_once` calls from tests/*, especially where they load files from the demo dir
